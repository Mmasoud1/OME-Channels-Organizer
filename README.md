The tool is using Digital Slide Archive as a backbone to update the image metadata remotely or locally.

To run locally, just start up a simple local server from the root level of the repository.

For the online version, you need to create your account on any DSA servers and upload your OME file and basic omeDescription metadata as in this link:
